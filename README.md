## Introduction

I collaborated with my brother to build a React web app which targets users like himself - **RC car enthusiasts**. The user would enter 4 values, and the app will measure the weight balance and diagonal balance of the RC car. The inspiration behind it came from a similar app that he had discovered online, but theirs had incorporated Bluetooth-enabled scales, so the user wouldn't even need to enter the readings manually.

## My role

I was mostly involved with styling the app with vanilla CSS. The layout of the car image with the 4 inputs were achived with CSS Grid. Prior to my involvement, my brother had already completed most of the app functionality. The calculation formula can be viewed in [this file](src/components/services/calcService.js).

### Demo

Here is an image on how to get the values you would need to enter inside the app, just place the scales underneath each tyre of the RC car, and the screen will display the values.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
